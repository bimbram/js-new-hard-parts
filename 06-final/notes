002 - Wrapping Up
-To get a mid-level or senior JS code, you need to have an under the hood understanding


001 - Async Await
-Async/await simplifies all this and finally fixes the inversion of control problem of callback

async function createFlow() {
  console.log('me first')
  const data = await fetch('http//twitter.com/will/tweets/1')
  console.log(data)
}

createFlow();

console.log('Me second')

No need for a triggered function on the promise resolution, instead we auto trigger the resumption of the create flow execution (this functionality is still added to the microtask queue though)
